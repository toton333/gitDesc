//cloning wordpress site from remote server to localhost with cheap hosting
//where upload/download filesize is 10mb or less(sigh!)

1.Install wordpress in localhost
2.Install all in one migration plugin in both remote and local wordpress.
3.Install and activate all plugins in localhost.
4.Export theme files only using all in one on remote. FTP works also cause of small size.
5.Import theme files to local using all in one.
6.FTP upload folder from remote to local(for media files)
7.Finally Export/import sql from remote to local using all in one.


//The main trick is gotta install all plugin manually to destination wordpress
  to avoid large file download/upload.
